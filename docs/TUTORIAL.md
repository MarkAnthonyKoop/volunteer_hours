![Main interface](images/main-interface.png)

- **üìä Dashboard** - Your volunteer statistics
- **‚ûï Log Hours** - Add new entries
- **üìã History** - View all your entries

---

## Step 2: Log Your First Volunteer Entry (3 minutes)

Let's log a volunteer activity! We'll use a real example.

### 2.1 Click the "Log Hours" Tab

![Log Hours tab](images/tutorial-log-hours-tab.png)

### 2.2 Fill in the Required Information

**Example: Food Bank Volunteering**

#### Date (Required)
Click the date field and select when you volunteered. Let's say October 10, 2025.

![Date picker](images/date-picker.png)

**Tip:** You can select any past date, but not future dates.

---

#### Organization (Required)
Type the name of the organization. Let's use "Local Food Bank".

![Organization field](images/organization-field.png)

**Tip:** After you enter an organization once, the app will suggest it next time!

---

#### Activity/Project (Required)
Describe what you did. Let's enter "Food sorting and distribution".

![Activity field](images/activity-field.png)

**Tip:** Be specific! "Food sorting" is better than just "volunteering".

---

#### Hours (Required)
How long did you volunteer? Let's say 3.5 hours (3 hours and 30 minutes).

![Hours field](images/hours-field.png)

**Quick Reference:**
- 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
- 1 hour 15 minutes = 1.25 hours
- 2 hours 30 minutes = 2.5 hours

---

### 2.3 Add Optional Details (Makes Your Records Better!)

#### Category (Optional but recommended)
Select a category. For our food bank example, choose "Social Services".

![Category dropdown](images/category-dropdown.png)

**Available categories:**
- Education
- Environment
- Health
- Social Services
- Arts & Culture
- Animal Welfare
- Community Development
- Other

---

#### Description (Optional but helpful)
Add extra details. For example: "Sorted 200 lbs of food donations and prepared 50 food packages for families."

![Description field](images/description-field.png)

**Why add a description?** It helps you remember the impact you made!

---

### 2.4 Click "Add Entry"

Your form should look like this:

![Completed form](images/tutorial-completed-form.png)

Click the green **"Add Entry"** button at the bottom.

![Add entry button](images/add-entry-button.png)

### 2.5 Success!

You'll see a green success message, and the app automatically switches to the History tab to show your new entry.

![Success message](images/tutorial-success-message.png)

**üéâ Congratulations!** You've logged your first volunteer entry!

---

## Step 3: View Your Dashboard (2 minutes)

Now let's see your volunteer impact!

### 3.1 Click the "Dashboard" Tab

![Dashboard tab](images/tutorial-dashboard-tab.png)

### 3.2 View Your Statistics

At the top, you'll see four key numbers:

![Dashboard stats](images/dashboard-stats.png)

1. **Total Hours** - All the volunteer hours you've logged (3.5 hours)
2. **Total Entries** - Number of volunteer sessions (1 entry)
3. **Organizations** - How many different organizations (1 organization)
4. **This Month** - Hours volunteered this month (3.5 hours)

### 3.3 View Your Charts

Scroll down to see the **"Hours by Organization"** chart:

![Organization chart](images/org-chart.png)

This bar chart shows which organizations you've helped the most. As you add more entries, this chart will grow!

### 3.4 View Recent Activity

Below the chart, you'll see your **Recent Activity**:

![Recent activity](images/recent-activity.png)

This shows your last 5 volunteer entries with:
- Organization name
- Activity description
- Hours volunteered
- Date

**Tip:** This is a quick way to see what you've been doing lately!

---

## Step 4: Add More Entries (Practice!) (2 minutes)

Let's add a couple more entries so you can see how the app works with multiple records.

### Example 2: Animal Shelter

Click **"Log Hours"** tab and enter:

```
Date: October 8, 2025
Organization: Animal Shelter
Activity: Dog walking and kennel cleaning
Hours: 2
Category: Animal Welfare
Description: Walked 5 dogs and cleaned 10 kennels
```

![Second entry example](images/tutorial-entry-2.png)

Click **"Add Entry"**.

### Example 3: Library

Add one more:

```
Date: October 5, 2025
Organization: Public Library
Activity: Reading program for children
Hours: 1.5
Category: Education
Description: Read to 15 children in after-school program
```

![Third entry example](images/tutorial-entry-3.png)

Click **"Add Entry"**.

### Check Your Dashboard Again!

Go back to the **Dashboard** tab. Notice how your stats have changed:

![Updated dashboard](images/tutorial-updated-dashboard.png)

- **Total Hours:** 7 hours (3.5 + 2 + 1.5)
- **Total Entries:** 3 entries
- **Organizations:** 3 organizations
- **This Month:** 7 hours

The chart now shows all three organizations!

---

## Step 5: Search and Filter Your History (1 minute)

Now let's learn how to find specific entries.

### 5.1 Open the History Tab

Click the **"History"** tab to see all your entries.

![History view](images/history-view.png)

### 5.2 Try the Search

Type "dog" in the search box at the top:

![Search box](images/search-box.png)

The app instantly filters to show only entries containing "dog" (your Animal Shelter entry).

![Search results](images/tutorial-search-results.png)

**Try searching for:**
- Organization names: "Food Bank"
- Activities: "reading"
- Categories: "Education"
- Anything in the description: "children"

### 5.3 Try the Filters

Clear the search box. Now click the **"Filter by Organization"** dropdown:

![Filters](images/filters.png)

Select "Local Food Bank" - now you'll see only entries for that organization.

![Filtered results](images/tutorial-filtered-results.png)

**You can also filter by:**
- Category (Education, Health, etc.)
- Combination of both!

### 5.4 Try Sorting

Click the **"Sort By"** dropdown:

![Sort options](images/sort-options.png)

Try these options:
- **Date (Newest)** - Most recent first (default)
- **Date (Oldest)** - Oldest first
- **Hours (Most)** - Highest hours first
- **Hours (Least)** - Lowest hours first

**Tip:** Sort by "Hours (Most)" to see your biggest volunteer contributions!

---

## Step 6: Edit an Entry (1 minute)

Made a mistake? No problem! Let's edit an entry.

### 6.1 Find the Entry to Edit

In the History tab, locate your "Local Food Bank" entry.

### 6.2 Click the "Edit" Button

Click the **Edit** button on that entry:

![Edit entry](images/edit-entry.png)

### 6.3 Make Your Changes

The form opens with all the entry's information filled in. Let's say you actually volunteered for 4 hours instead of 3.5.

Change the **Hours** field to `4`.

![Editing form](images/tutorial-editing.png)

### 6.4 Save Your Changes

Click **"Update Entry"** at the bottom.

![Update button](images/tutorial-update-button.png)

## Common Questions

### "Can I log hours on multiple devices?"

Each device stores its own data. Export from one device and keep the file if you want to switch devices.

**Coming soon:** Cloud sync in Phase 2!

### "What if I accidentally delete an entry?"

Deletions cannot be undone. That's why we have a confirmation popup!

**Prevention:** Export your data regularly as backup.

### "Can I import data from a spreadsheet?"

Not currently in the UI. But if you have an export, you can manually import it via browser console.

**Coming soon:** User-friendly import in Phase 2!

### "Does this work offline?"

**Yes!** The app is a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It works completely offline after the first load.

### "Where is my data stored?"

Your data is stored in your browser's local storage on your device. It never leaves your device.

**Important:** Don't use Private/Incognito mode, or your data will be deleted when you close the browser!
