# Screenshot Requirements Guide

This document describes all screenshots needed for the user documentation.

## Quick Start: Automated Capture ðŸš€

The fastest way to capture all screenshots is using the automated Python script:

```bash
# 1. Start the app server
cd /home/tony/winefred
./start-server.sh

# 2. In another terminal, run the automated capture
cd docs
./capture-all-screenshots.sh
```

This will automatically:
- âœ… Open the app in Chrome
- âœ… Add sample volunteer entries
- âœ… Navigate through all screens
- âœ… Capture all 33 screenshots (34 total, 1 requires manual mobile capture)
- âœ… Save to `docs/images/` with correct filenames

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.7+
- Google Chrome
- ChromeDriver (installed automatically by script or via `apt install chromium-chromedriver`)

**Time:** ~2-3 minutes for all screenshots

---

## Manual Capture (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to capture screenshots manually or the automated script doesn't work, follow the instructions below.
