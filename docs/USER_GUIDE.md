## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "My data disappeared!"

**Cause**: Browser data was cleared, or using incognito/private mode

**Solution**:
- Don't use incognito/private browsing mode
- Export your data regularly as backup
- Check if you're using the same browser
- Look for recent exports you can restore from

#### "The app won't load"

**Solution**:
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Clear your browser cache
- Check the browser console for errors

#### "I can't add decimal hours"

**Solution**:
- Use a period (.) not a comma: `2.5` not `2,5`
- Minimum is 0.25 (15 minutes)

#### "My organization names are messy"

**Solution**:
- Edit old entries to use consistent names
- The app learns from your entries and suggests past organizations
- Use the exact same name each time for an organization

#### "I accidentally deleted an entry"

**Solution**:
- Unfortunately, deletions cannot be undone
- If you have a recent export, you can reference the data there
- Be careful with the Delete button - there's a confirmation for this reason!

#### "The app is slow"

**Solution**:
- Clear old entries you don't need
- Export and clear all data if you have many hundreds of entries
- Close other browser tabs
- Try on a different device
