```

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The app works immediately without any setup.

### Option 2: Run with HTTP Server (Recommended for PWA features)

Using Python:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

Using Node.js:
```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
```

### Option 3: Install as PWA
1. Open the app in Chrome/Edge
2. Click the install icon in the address bar
3. Use as a standalone app

## Usage Guide

### Adding Volunteer Hours

1. Click the **Log Hours** tab
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Date**: When you volunteered (defaults to today)
   - **Organization**: Name of the organization
   - **Activity/Project**: What you did
   - **Hours**: How long you volunteered (minimum 0.25 hours)
   - **Category**: Optional classification (Education, Health, etc.)
   - **Description**: Optional additional details
3. Click **Add Entry**
4. Entry is saved and you're taken to the History view

### Viewing Statistics

Click the **Dashboard** tab to see:
- Total hours across all entries
- Number of volunteer entries
- Number of unique organizations
- Hours logged this month
- Top 10 organizations by hours (chart)
- 5 most recent activities

### Managing Entries

In the **History** tab:
- **Search**: Type keywords to filter entries
- **Filter**: Use dropdowns to filter by organization or category
- **Sort**: Change sort order by date or hours
- **Edit**: Click Edit button to modify an entry
- **Delete**: Click Delete button (confirmation required)
- **Export**: Download all data as JSON
- **Clear All**: Remove all entries (confirmation required)

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The app follows a class-based architecture with a single `VolunteerTracker` class that manages all functionality:

```javascript
class VolunteerTracker {
    constructor()           // Initialize app
    loadFromStorage()       // Load data from localStorage
    saveToStorage()         // Save data to localStorage
    calculateStats()        // Compute dashboard statistics
    render()                // Update UI
    // ... more methods
}
```

### Data Model

Each volunteer entry has the following structure:

```javascript
{
    id: "unique-timestamp",
    date: "2024-01-15",
    organization: "Local Food Bank",
    activity: "Food sorting and distribution",
    hours: 3.5,
    category: "Social Services",
    description: "Helped sort donations and prepare food packages",
    createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Local Storage

Data is stored in `localStorage` under the key `volunteerEntries` as a JSON array. This provides:
- Persistence across browser sessions
- No server required
- Fast read/write operations
- ~5-10MB storage capacity (browser-dependent)

### Security

The app includes XSS protection:
- All user input is escaped before rendering
- HTML special characters are converted to entities
- No `innerHTML` with user content
- No `eval()` or similar dangerous functions

### Browser Compatibility

Tested and works in:
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

Requires:
- ES6 support (classes, arrow functions, etc.)
- localStorage API
- Fetch API (for PWA manifest)

## Testing

### Automated Tests

Open `tests/test.html` in a browser and click "Run All Tests". The test suite includes:

- **Initialization Tests**: Verify app starts correctly
- **Data Persistence Tests**: localStorage save/load
- **Entry Management Tests**: Add, edit, delete operations
- **Statistics Tests**: Calculation accuracy
- **Filtering/Sorting Tests**: Search and sort functionality
- **Utility Tests**: Date formatting, HTML escaping
- **Edge Cases**: Large datasets, empty states, malformed data
- **Validation Tests**: Error handling

**Current Test Results**: All tests passing âœ“

### Manual Testing

Follow the checklist in `tests/manual-verification.md` for comprehensive manual testing covering:
- User workflows
- Mobile responsiveness
- Browser compatibility
- Performance
- Security

git push -u origin main
# Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
```

**Netlify**: Drag and drop the folder

**Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo or use CLI

### Domain & HTTPS
For PWA features (install, notifications), HTTPS is required. Most hosting services provide free HTTPS via Let's Encrypt.
