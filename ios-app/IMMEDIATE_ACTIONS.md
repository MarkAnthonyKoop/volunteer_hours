## 💡 Pro Tips

### Fastest Path:
1. Start Apple Developer enrollment NOW
2. While waiting, set up Codemagic account
3. Once Apple approves (check email), do API key steps
4. Trigger build
5. Wait 20 minutes
6. Install on iPhone

### If Apple Takes 24-48 Hours:
- Don't worry, this is normal
- You can do everything else (Codemagic, etc.)
- Just can't trigger final build until Apple approves
- Check email regularly

### Save Your Credentials:
- Apple Developer login
- App Store Connect API key (.p8 file)
- Issuer ID and Key ID
- You'll need these for future builds

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Bundle ID already exists"
Someone else registered it. Change in `capacitor.config.ts`:
```typescript
appId: 'com.winefred.volunteerhours2'  // or your name
```

### "Build failed: Code signing"
- Check that API key is correct in Codemagic
- Make sure Apple Developer account is active
- Check build logs for specific error

### "No email from TestFlight"
- Check spam folder
- Wait 10 minutes after build completes
- Check App Store Connect > TestFlight section manually

### "Can't download .p8 file again"
- Create a new API key
- Delete old one if needed
- Download immediately this time
