- Free
- Best option if available

## Installation Steps (Once You Have Mac)

### 1. Update macOS
```bash
# Check for updates
System Preferences > Software Update

# Update to latest version
# Requires restart
```

### 2. Install Xcode
```bash
# Option A: App Store (Recommended)
# Open App Store
# Search "Xcode"
# Click "Get" or "Install"
# Wait ~1 hour for 15GB download

# Option B: Developer Portal
# Visit https://developer.apple.com/download/
# Sign in with Apple ID (free)
# Download Xcode 14+
# Drag to /Applications
```

### 3. Install Command Line Tools
```bash
xcode-select --install

# Dialog will appear
# Click "Install"
# Wait ~5 minutes
```

### 4. Accept Xcode License
```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept

# Or open Xcode once and accept GUI prompt
```

### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
xcodebuild -version
# Should show: Xcode 14.0 or higher

xcrun simctl list devices
# Should list iOS simulators
```

### 6. Install iOS Simulators
```bash
# Open Xcode
# Xcode > Settings > Platforms
# Click iOS
# Download iOS 16.0+ simulator
# Wait ~10GB download
```

## Alternative: Windows + Virtual Machine

### ❌ NOT Recommended

**Why It Doesn't Work Well:**
- macOS in VM on Windows is technically possible (Hackintosh)
- Violates Apple's EULA
- Very slow simulator performance
- Difficult setup
- Breaks with macOS updates
- Cannot publish to App Store without real Mac for final build

**If You Must Try:**
- VirtualBox or VMware
- macOS Monterey+ ISO (gray area legally)
- Allocate 8GB+ RAM to VM
- Expect 50% performance loss
- Only for learning, not production

## Alternative: Linux + Alternatives

### Cross-Platform Options

**Flutter + Fastlane**
- Build on Linux, deploy via cloud
- Requires Mac for final signing
- Complex setup

**React Native + Expo**
- Can build via Expo cloud
- Limited native features
- Not compatible with our Capacitor app

**Capacitor + Cloud Build**
- No good solutions currently
- Ionic Appflow (paid service)
- Still needs Mac for development/testing

### Conclusion
**Just get a Mac.** A used M1 MacBook Air for $600 is the most cost-effective solution.

## Recommendations by Budget

### Budget: $0
1. Borrow Mac from friend/family
2. Use GitHub Actions (build-only, no GUI)
3. Find local hackerspace with Mac
4. Apple Store developer lab

### Budget: $300-500
1. **Used MacBook Air 2017-2019 (Intel)** - $300-400
2. Used MacBook Pro 2015-2017 (Intel) - $350-450
3. MacinCloud for 10-15 months - $300-450

### Budget: $600-800
1. **Used MacBook Air M1 (2020)** - $600-700 ⭐ BEST VALUE
2. Used MacBook Pro 2018-2019 (Intel) - $500-650
3. MacinCloud for 20 months - $600

### Budget: $1000+
1. **New MacBook Air M2 (2024)** - $1,099 ⭐ FUTURE-PROOF
2. New MacBook Air M1 (clearance) - $899
3. Used MacBook Pro M1 (2020) - $900-1000
