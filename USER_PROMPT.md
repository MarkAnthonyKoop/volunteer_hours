# Volunteer Hours Tracker - Professional Full-Stack Application

## Mission

Build a production-ready, professional-grade volunteer hours tracking system that organizations and individuals can use to log, manage, analyze, and report volunteer activities. The system should integrate with Google services (Drive, Sheets, Calendar) and provide a modern, scalable architecture.

## Architecture Overview

This is a multi-tier application that should be decomposed into the following subprojects:

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Status
Phase 1 (Frontend MVP) is **COMPLETE** with:
- Working PWA with local storage
- Full CRUD operations
- Comprehensive test suite
- Mobile-responsive design
- Documentation

### Next Steps - Use Atom Decomposition

1. **Create Backend Foundation**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p api database authentication
   cd api
   # Create USER_PROMPT.md for API subproject
   atom  # This will build the API in its own context
   ```

2. **Each Subproject Should**:
   - Have its own USER_PROMPT.md
   - Build independently
   - Include tests
   - Document its API/interface
   - Have a README.md

3. **Integration Points**:
   - API communicates via REST/GraphQL
   - Database accessed only through API
   - Frontend calls API endpoints
   - Google services isolated in modules

4. **Deployment**:
   - Frontend: Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify)
   - Backend: Container hosting (Fly.io, Railway, AWS)
   - Database: Managed service (Supabase, PlanetScale)

## Development Workflow

1. **Phase 1**: ✓ COMPLETE - Frontend MVP
2. **Phase 2**: Backend Infrastructure (current priority)
   - Start with `api/` subproject
   - Then `database/` subproject
   - Then `authentication/` subproject
3. **Phase 3**: Google Integration
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced Features
5. **Phase 5**: Production Deployment

## Notes for Atom Implementation

- **Decompose by domain**: Each major feature becomes a subproject
- **Interface first**: Define APIs before implementation
- **Test as you build**: Each subproject must have tests
- **Document decisions**: Update README.md with architecture decisions
- **Integration last**: Build components independently, integrate after

## Current Task

**For this iteration**: Update README.md to reflect this professional architecture and provide clear guidance on how to build out the remaining phases using the atom decomposition pattern.

After README.md update, the project will be ready for Phase 2 development where each subproject can be built by spawning atoms in their respective directories.
